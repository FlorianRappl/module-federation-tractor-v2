### Limitations

This implementation is deliberately kept simple to focus on the micro frontends aspects. URLs are hardcoded, components could be more DRY and no linting, testing or type-safety is implemented. In a real-world scenario, these aspects should be addressed properly.

### Performance

Several performance optimizations could still be applied, however, in the out-of-the-box state with three micro frontends and multiple components / pages included we'll end up with a lighthouse score of 100/100, which is great.

![Lighthouse Score](./lighthouse.png)

As a comparison a most lightweight SSR-only solution using the same codebase would be around 99/100. Another SPA sample that uses [Picard.js](https://picard.js.org/) with Native Federation ended up at 88/100. Hence, Piral gives optimal performance - no effort needed.

## How to run locally

### Installation

```sh
./setup.sh
```

### Running the Code

Now you can run all micro frontends:

```sh
./run.sh
```
